要更改控件的background-color 在QSS里setstyle要加上一句 border:none 使原生border失效

This doesn't work for me on PyQt 5.14. I have to set （border:  none） to change color, according to this answer. 
it seems bizarre that one needs now to remove the border in order to change the background color

For those who still want to change color of button with the instruction
button.setStyleSheet('QPushButton {background-color: #A3C1DA}')
and not able to do so, just modify the above instruction to
button.setStyleSheet('QPushButton {background-color: #A3C1DA; border:  none}')
And it will change the button color, so the trick is to remove the border
